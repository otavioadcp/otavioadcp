## Otavio Pimentel 🇧🇷

### Senior software engineer

I'm have over 8 years of experience in building **robust and scalable solutions**. 
My career began with a focus on **front-end development** and has evolved into a **full-stack** role over the past few years, allowing me to bridge the gap between **interface design and system architecture**.
